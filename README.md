# Project Overview
This sign-in application is used for general data collection. I first had the idea while working in an innovation lab called The Sandbox at the Foreign Service Institute. The features it already includes are a GUI, two text entry boxes, and two drop down menus. The application takes the data entered and writes it into a text file and a separate program writes the text file data into an excel file to store the data and ideally generate graphs. 

Educational Goals Achieved: Contribution to this Open Sourced Project would allow students to demonstrate practical application in front end programming, debugging, access to database, code profiling and optimization, and design patterns.
