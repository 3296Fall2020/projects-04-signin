## Project Overview
This sign-in application is used for general data collection. I first had the idea while working in an innovation lab called The Sandbox at the Foreign Service Institute. The features it already includes are a GUI, two text entry boxes, and two drop down menus. The application takes the data entered and writes it into a text file and a separate program writes the text file data into an excel file to store the data and ideally generate graphs.

Educational Goals Achieved: Contribution to this Open Sourced Project would allow students to demonstrate practical application in front end programming, debugging, access to database, code profiling and optimization, and design patterns.

## Vision Statement 

## Three Personas
### Persona 1: Government Agency
Sign in entries would consist of agency employees as well as employees from other bureaus. They could be checking into work or they could be meeting with somebody at the agency. Could be used to track who is visiting who, hours worked by employees, and success of the business.

### Persona 2: Volunteer Organization
Sign in entries would consist of volunteers at different locations signing in for their shift. Could be used to keep track of worker demographics, hours worked, and the number of employees in each location or position. 

### Persona 3: Doctor's Office
Sign in entries would consist of patients.  Could keep track of reason for visit and demographics, as well as frequency of visits. This could help to track recurring issues in patients or track how certain issues affect certain demographics.
